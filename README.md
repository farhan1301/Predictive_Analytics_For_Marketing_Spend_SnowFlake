-> This GitHub repository hosts a project focused on data engineering (encompassing data analysis and preparation) and machine learning to develop a Linear Regression model. 
-> The model's purpose is to predict the Return On Investment (ROI) for varying advertising budgets across multiple channels, including search, video, social media, and email. Utilizing Snowpark for Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn, the project culminates in the deployment of an interactive web application. 
-> This application visualizes the ROI for different advertising spend allocations, allowing users to explore how budget variations impact ROI. 
The repository provides all necessary code, documentation, and resources to replicate and understand the project's outcomes.
